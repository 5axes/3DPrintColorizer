# Software Setup
## Installing the Cura plugin
The software is implemented as a Cura [link] plugin. To install the plugin just copy the plugin script in the *plugin* folder under *..\Ultimaker Cura x.x.x\plugins\PostProcessingPlugin\scripts*. If you had cura running you need to restart it after copying the plugin.
After starting/restarting Cura you need to activate the plugin. Go to *Extensions->Post Processing->Modify G-Code*, click on *add a script" and chose the *PenColorizer* script.
Make sure to remove the script from the list before you try to slice a non-colored model!
