# Hardware setup
## Printing the parts
First print the 3 STL files located in the *Hardware* folder. Right now only the files for an Ender 3 (or similar Ender 3 clone) are provided. It´s adviced to print all the files with a brim so they are perfectly flat and don´t topple over while printing.
## Preparing the pens
To prepare the sharpies for printing place the end cap on the back of the pen. The cap should hold the pen tightly and don´t slip of easily.

## Mounting the parts
You need to mount the pen holder to your extruder head first. To do so you need to unscrew the 2 screws shown in the picture.

Now put the mounting part in place and screw everything back in. After that You can mount the pen holder to the mounting part with 3 M2 screws.
The pen rack needs to be mounted to the upper t-slot profile of your printer. If you have an Ender 3 you should have 2 spare screws and corrosponding t nuts you can use for that.
To reduce stress on the bowden cable it is adviced to place the rack as far left as possible. 
**Important:** when mounting the racket you need make sure that a pen sitting in the pen holder can be easily slided in and out of the individual rack holders!
